3088 PiHat
A battery will be used to supply the piHAT with power. There will be a subsystem that will convert the battery voltage to the voltage suitable for the piHAT.The second system will be a voltage regulator, it will keep the output of this circuit to that of the required voltage 0-3.3V. The third subsystem consist of an LED circuit. The percentage of the battery will be indicated using the colours of the three LEDs (red, green and blue). The battery indication by the LEDs will help shut down the piHAt properly as immediate shutdown might damage some components of the HAT.
